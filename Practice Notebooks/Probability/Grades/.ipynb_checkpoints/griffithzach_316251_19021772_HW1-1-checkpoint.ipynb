    "The results of this histogram are pretty interesting. On the above histogram you can see that people in their 20s had more survivals than deaths. Once you get into the 30s, more died than survived. I think this falls in line with the chivalry aspect of the survival rate because people in their 20s have a lot to lose, but the people in their 30s feel a greater sense of responsibility and are probably family men/women. Unfortunately children across the board were more likely to die. Probably because of their lack of understanding. "

AFTER, you've done that, remove any rows (which correspond to years) with missing data. As a check, if you've cleaned the file correctly, there should be 121 rows remaining. "
