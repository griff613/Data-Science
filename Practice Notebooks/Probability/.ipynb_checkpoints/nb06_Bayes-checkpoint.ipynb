    "Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, Monty, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No. 2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?\n",

([Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1BSkquWkDo) is a snippet from an interview with Monty Hall about it.)  It is a problem posed by Marilyn vos Savant in _Parade_ magazine in 1990.  The fallout was intense.  Read more [here](https://priceonomics.com/the-time-everyone-corrected-the-worlds-smartest/) and [here](http://marilynvossavant.com/game-show-problem/)."
